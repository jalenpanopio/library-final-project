          <i>All the Bright Places</i> written by Jennifer Niven is a story of two mentally troubled teens, Violet Markey and Theodore Finch, and their coincidental meeting that created temporary happiness. Highly suggested book, as it speaks on the topic of mental illness in adolescents in our society.

          <i>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</i> written by Jenny Han is an unlikely love between Peter Kavinsky, the popular lacrosse player, and Laura Jean Covey, the shy quiet book lover. The book contains fan favorite tropes, such as fake dating. Extremely fun read for teens!

          <i>The Series of Unfortunate Events</i> written by Lemony Snicket is a nostalgic book series very close to my heart. The story of three orphans going through constant tragedies encaptured my attention. Their strong family bonds and the use of high level vocabulary makes this series unique. Although it is considered a children's book, I still suggest you give it a try!
